This is a very small work-in-progress that presently only has a GUI, nothing functional yet.

Compilation:
============

This requires the *qmake* build tool, the Qt development libraries, a working C++ compiler, and a version of *make*

- Run `qmake` in the source tree to generate the Makefile.
- Compile the project by executing `make`.

Execution:
==========

If the compilation step succeeded, an executable, 'glsl-tester', will be available in the source tree.
