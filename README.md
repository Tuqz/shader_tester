This is a very WIP program that presently only has a gui, nothing functions yet.

Compilation:
============

This is very simple, first run:
`qmake`
then:
`make`

Execution:
==========
Running this program once compiled is simple, in bash shells and derivatives:
`./glsl-tester`

Thats it, enjoy. :)
